The second least populous of the WRA camps (to Amache), Topaz had a peak population of 8,130 inmates. Topaz had one of the most urban and most homogeneous populations with nearly its entire inmate population coming from the San Francisco Bay Area. Topaz is perhaps best known as the site of the fatal shooting of an inmate by an overzealous camp sentry in April 1943 and for its art school, which included a faculty roster of notable Issei and Nisei artists. It was also the site of significant protest against registration in the spring of 1943 and of a variety of labor disputes. The Topaz Museum, which opened to the public in 2015, is located in nearby Delta, Utah and today owns much of the land on which the camp had once been built.","Located at 4,600 feet of elevation in west-central Utah, Topaz was set in Millard County near the town of Delta, 140 miles southwest of Salt Lake City.

The largest and most populous of the War Relocation Authority (WRA) administered concentration camps (with the exception of post-segregation Tule Lake) with a peak population of nearly 18,000, Poston was unique among WRA camps in a number of ways. First, it was jointly managed by the Office of Indian Affairs (OIA), an arrangement that was troubled and that ended with the OIA withdrawing by the beginning of 1944. Secondly, it was divided into three separate camps arranged in a line about three miles apart. It likely had the most rural population, its inmates hailing mostly from farming areas of southern, central and coastal California. Finally, about 2/3 of its population came directly to Poston without going to an assembly center first, something that set it apart from all other WRA camps with the exception of Manzanar. Poston's Unit I was also the site of a fall 1942 mass strike that was one of two well publicized blow-ups on WRA camps that influenced WRA policies in the years to come.","Located at 320 feet of elevation in southwestern Arizona on the Colorado River Reservation in Yuma County (now La Paz), 12 miles south of the town of Parker.

Gila consisted of two separate camps about four miles apart, which came to be called Canal and Butte, with the latter about twice as large as the former. The population of Gila came almost entirely from California and included a mixture of rural populations from the Central Valley and coast and urban populations from Los Angeles. Included in the population were about 3,000 who came directly there from the ""white zone"" without having gone to an ""assembly center"" first. Due in large part to its unique appearance—barracks at Gila were covered by white beaverboard and topped with red double roofs—Gila was regarded as the model camp and hosted such visitors as Eleanor Roosevelt, who visited in April 1943. Gila had perhaps the most extensive agricultural program of any of the WRA camps; in addition to supplying all of the vegetables consumed at the camp during peak production periods, Gila also supplied 20% of the produce consumed at other WRA camps as well. As one of the key sites of the Japanese American Evacuation and Resettlement Project, Gila was also one of the best documented of the WRA sites.","Located in a valley within the Gila River Indian Reservation in Pinal County, 50 miles south of Phoenix, 3 miles north of the Sacaton Mountains.

It's inmate population came almost entirely from California and consisted initially of Japanese Americans from the Merced and Santa Anita Assembly Centers, though significant numbers of inmates later transferred from Tule Lake and Jerome. Relative to other camps, there was little overt unrest at Amache, and Amache had a low number of inmates who gave ""no-no"" answers to the ""loyalty questionnaire"" and a large number of volunteers for military service, which fueled its reputation as ""good"" camp. Amache also had a relatively stable administration—it was the only camp to have one director for its entire life—and relatively less contentious relationships with the nearest towns.

Jerome also had the distinction of receiving over eight hundred inmates directly from Hawai'i, the largest contingent sent to any WRA camp. All of Jerome's initial inmate population was from California, either from the Fresno area, Florin and other areas south of Sacramento, or various areas in Los Angeles County. Due in part to the Hawai'i contingent—along with a sizable ""organized group"" from California who favored repatriation/expatriation to Japan—Jerome had the lowest rate of ""yes"" answers to Question 28, the highest rate of segregants to Tule Lake and the lowest rate of volunteers for the armed forces.

After about ten weeks under WCCA administration, it officially became a WRA camp on June 1, 1942. Thus, essentially all of Manzanar's 10,000 inmates went directly to Manzanar without passing through another ""assembly center."" Despite having a relatively homogeneous population—nearly 90% of its inmates came from the Los Angeles area—Manzanar was beset with unrest in its first year, culminating with what has been called both a ""riot"" and an ""uprising"" in December 1942 that saw military police firing into a crown resulting the deaths of two inmates. Manzanar also had one of the highest rates of segregation to Tule Lake and one of the lowest rates of volunteers for the military among WRA camps. Undoubtedly the best-known, most photographed, and most visited of the WRA camps, it has been the subject of numerous books, movies and exhibitions.

Along with Jerome, Rohwer's location exposed inmates to the unique climate and racial politics of the South, and the camps' relative proximity to Camps Shelby and Robinson led to regular interactions between camp inmates and Nisei soldiers training at the two military facilities. While other WRA camps saw their populations gradually decline as inmates began leaving the camp as early as the fall of 1942, Rohwer's substantially increased in the summer of 1944 when nearly 2,500 inmates transferred over from Jerome after that camp's closure.
